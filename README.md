Hi, everyone. I don't know if this will workout or not, but I am just keen on open sourcing a small page I wrote which 
I want to see expand into where ever you all want to take it. 


This books is primarily about a journal that is being kept by an indivisual much into the future who wants at a later stage,
in his life go to the blackhole.


I'd love to have contributions from you, not only from the protaginist himself, but maybe other citizens of this planet of 
the future. The stories can be coinciding or maybe not. I'd love to have multiple seperate stories that coincide at a much
later stage too, it was would be almost like a multlayered tale. 


Looking forward to your contributions!
