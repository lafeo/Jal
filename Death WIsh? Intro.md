Just looking down at the furthest star my eyes could possibly see, I was a small glimmer. It was so subtle that I almost doubted my eyes, but then it happened again. 
The star was so far, so far that this wink had to travel at least a million years. 

This had happened when I was 18, when the universe had spread so thin, and so far that our darkest skies didn’t have a single twinkle. I hoped for someone else to notice this as well, I was just a child when a star winked at me for the first time in my life, but apparently not. I felt like the only one who ever witnessed this. 

I am still in the same place I call home, the same window through which the universe flirted with me. The place where I got the first scar in my eye after looking at the eclipse, the same window where I first thought of my death wish. 

I think everyone has a death wish, one can love as much as they want, one can work and be passionate, but the lingering thought of demise sits somewhere there. 
Hold up, though. I am in no way saying I’m suicidal, I don’t even think death is facinating, but I think if one has lived a good long life, I’d say upto around 80, and is fit. I hope to be fit, they should definately sacrifice themselves for something that someone living shouldn’t be subjected to. 

We wouldn’t know about our own bodies if we never inspected the dead, would we? AHAHA, I know I sound a little dark, but I think someone, even if it takes a another million years to get there, at least someone should expereince what it feels like to be inside a black hole, and I hope they can relay what they see back, I hope I can relay that back, but even if not, I’m sure my conciousness will save it and maybe someone else gets the rift of it. 

Our closest blackhole, has gone even fruther away from us, Earth was our first planet we inhabited but we slowly started moving away from our sun, because our solar system kept getting pulled closer to it, and they say in the next 20 years, the Earth would become the next Mercury. 
We still have just one planet, we somehow keep finding an extra planet and our history books keeps calling it an outlier event. Someone definately wants us to survive.

Our ancestors used to be so busy with finding patterns in the universe, and trying to find god. We haven’t found The God yet, but we are so used to predicting the future that even a kid in Kal 4 can find out where to look for the next Earth. The universe isn’t a myestery anymore, it almost as if the universe keeps expanding using the seed and logic that it used to. For our ancestors that was definately new, it was novel, it look years before we realised how the universe is repeating itself.

Anyway, I keep getting carried away, because I’m trying to write something that I can carry to the blackhole with me, so just incase if anyone gets a hold of this book they can realise where our species has been. I’ve been studying history ever since finishing my studies. I’ve used almost 19 brains so far and spent so much money on maintaining my age that now my no one wants me to die, they think I’ve become this Prophet of worldly wisdom, so everyone keeps sending me Enz and I keep spending it.

Money is still ruthless I would say, its much worse than what it used to be, because now we transact based of our real potential. 
There are parks everywhere, and whenever we have time we have to go and contribute by doing any sort of activity to generate energy that will be used to power everything. 

Anyway, this is just the intro, I’m hoping to keep a log of at least the next few years of my life until I reach the Blackhole, I’d say another Jal? Maybe a little more. However what bothers me in that little light I saw years back. My heart says I should wait for another wink. 
Our days are longer, but I would say that’s because we’ve become faster only because I’ve tried using older minds, minds that have been preserved and they just seem so heavy, the energy required to think in them I feel was such a waste. 
I’m writing all of this as I’m making my way to Kelz Junction which is where majority of us go to power the grid. 

I’ve used this body for far too long, it’s been with me for almost a year now, and I think it’s about to die off really soon. Pain isn’t real anymore, because our minds haven’t felt fear or an instinct to protect ourselves for so long, that feeling pain has become more of a obstacle so for those who do feel it, we just advise them to either hop into a new body or just take meds. 
Usually bodies can last at least two years with the amount of effort it puts into generating power, however you can definately start feeling tired in it after a year itself. 

I’ve started feeling pain though, I had to because of my research, history says it’s the one thing that go us to where it is. It was really dark, with thoughts being slow, body requiring so much energy input from the mind and on top of that feeling every sensation as the body feels was baffling, in my eyes it was unnecessary. Don’t get me wrong, we still have a very similar body.
